# SoftwareDefectIdentification

This project contains the datasets and some experimental results of the paper "Automated Defect Identification via Path Analysis-based Features with Transfer Learning" in the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS).

Details of the folders:

Dataset: the values of the two traditional features (CM features and VC features) and our proposed PVC features of the 8 open-source projects used in the paper

Experimental Result: the matched PVC pairs of each identification combination (a cutoff of 0.05 for the KS test)
